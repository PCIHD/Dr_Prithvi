Leaf spots are round, brown and can grow up to half inch in diameter.
Larger spots have target like concentric rings and tissue around spots often turns yellow
Severely infected leaves turn brown and fall off, or dead, dried leaves may cling to the stem
FRUIT:
Fruit can be infected at any stage of maturity
Fruit spots are leathery, black, with raised concentric ridges and generally occur near the stem
Infected fruit may drop from the plant

    <string name="Apple"> APPLE SCAB

    Symptoms on fruit are similar to those found on leaves.
    Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center.
    As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky.
    Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organism.
